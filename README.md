🔍 Features
Takes user input for the current Indian city

Uses geographic coordinates (latitude & longitude) to compute proximity

Implements K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to find closest cities

Converts Euclidean distances into real-world approximate kilometers

Error-handling for invalid city names

📊 Dataset
CSV file: indian_cities.csv
Contains: City, State, Latitude, Longitude of major Indian cities.

Technologies Used
Python

Pandas for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning (Nearest Neighbors model)
